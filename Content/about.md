# About

<img src="/images/about/abram.jpg" alt="Me" class="center profile-picture" />

I'm currently a student at [Institut Teknologi Bandung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandung_Institute_of_Technology), Indonesia pursuing a degree in Informatics Engineering (Computer Science equivalent). I am a curious person who has the dream to know everything about everything. Previously I worked on transport platform at [STOQO](https://stoqo.com) , iOS at [Tokopedia](https://tokopedia.com), and chat platform [Bukalapak](https://bukalapak.com).

I also enjoy having a discussion about life philosophy, leading,  and helping friends to be a better person. On my free time, I enjoy most of the popular sports in the world, notably Formula 1, Badminton, NBA, NFL, & Football.
