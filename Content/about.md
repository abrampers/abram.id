# About

<img src="/images/abram.jpg" alt="Me" class="center profile-picture" />

I'm currently a student at [Institut Teknologi Bandung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandung_Institute_of_Technology), Indonesia pursuing a degree in Informatics Engineering (Computer Science equivalent). I am a curious person who had the dream to know everything about everything. I love to code and have so much passion in solving problems especially in Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, and all of its applications. I have experience interning at Indonesia's Unicorn startup [Bukalapak](https://bukalapak.com) and [Tokopedia](https://tokopedia.com), and [STOQO](https://stoqo.com) as a Software Engineer Intern. In my internship days, I've touched a wide range problems from user facing problems, to back-end business logic-heavy problems.

Aside from all those technical experiences, I also enjoy having a discussion about life philosophy, leading,  and helping friends to be a better person. In my free time I enjoy most of the popular sports in the world, most notably Formula 1, Badminton, NBA, NFL, & Football.
